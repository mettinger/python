Who will win the 2018/11/24 Taipei City Mayor election ? ","details":"選舉結果以 \"中華民國中央選舉委員會\"  ( 簡稱 中選會 )\n於台灣時間 2018/12/1 00:00:00 之前的正式公告為準。\n中選會網站 : https://www.cec.gov.tw/\n\n如果中選會公告的當選人不是 \"柯文哲\" 、 \"姚文智\" 或 \"丁守中\" 的話， \n請回報結果為 \"其他\"。\n\n如果中選會沒有於台灣時間 2018/12/1 00:00:00 之前公告當選人的話，\n不論原因為何 ( 包括選舉未如期舉行 )，也請回報結果為 \"其他\" 。\n\nMarket outcome should be reported according to the official election result announced by Taiwan’s “Central Election Commission” (CEC https://www.cec.gov.tw/) which is scheduled before 2018/12/1 00:00:00 ( Taiwan Time ). \n\nPlease report the market outcome as “其他” ( other ) if the result from CEC is neither  \"柯文哲 \" (Ko, Wen-je) nor  \"姚文智\" (Yao, Wen-chih) nor  \"丁守中\" (Ting, Shou-chung) . \n\nPlease also report the market outcome as “其他” ( other ) if the CEC , for any possible reason, failed to announce the result by  2018/12/1 00:00:00 (Taiwan Time). \n\n=== 以下說明僅供參考，與結果回報無關 ===\nAugur 預測市場的參與者經由交易代表各種結果的股份來預測事件的結果。\n舉個例子來說，請想像一個有 A、B 兩種可能結果的預測市場。 \nAlice 願意花 0.7 Eth 買一股代表 A 結果的股份，而 Bob 願意花 0.3 Eth 買一股代表 B 結果的股份。 \n首先，交易媒合引擎先將這兩筆交易配對並且向 Alice 和 Bob 兩人收取共 1 Eth ( 0.7 Eth + 0.3 Eth )。 \n然後 Augur 創造出一個新的完整股份包，把其中的 A 結果股份給 Alice，Ｂ結果股份給 Bob。 \n這就是各種的結果股份產生的過程。 一旦結果股份被產生出來之後，它們就可以被自由交易了。\n\n當市場所要預測的未來事件發生時，Augur 預測系統會確定事件的結果。 \n一但事件的結果被確定了，交易人就可以沖銷所持有的部位並且領取應得款項。\n也就是說，如果最後的結果是 A 的話 : \nAlice 可以拿自己持有的 A 股去換 1 Eth，獲利為 0.3 Eth ( 1 - 0.7 ) ，\n而 Bob 所持有的 B 股價值則歸零，損失為 0.3 Eth。\n反之亦然。\n\n關於 Augur : \nAugur 是一個不靠可信賴的中介者就能夠將真相導入區塊鏈的去中心化系統，同時也是一個預測市場平台。  \n每個人都可以在預測市場裡猜測未來事件的結果；\n猜對的人可以賺錢，猜錯的人則會賠錢。\n一個預測市場裡面的價格可以被當作是對於未來事件發生的可能性的精準且校對過的預測。\n\n人們能夠在 Augur 的預測市場裡用很低的手續費交易。\n市場參與者承擔的主要費用是用來付手續費給造市者以及回報事件結果的回報者。\n整個系統最終提供的是一個在市場競爭驅使下所能獲得的最不需要信賴中介者、\n阻力最小且費用最低的預測市場。\n\n從歷史的經驗來看，預測市場都是中心化的。然而，中心化的預測市場有很多風險及限制：\n它們限制可以被創建或交易的預測市場的種類，\n而且交易者被迫必須相信市場經營者不但不會偷他們錢而且還會正確地結算市場。\nAugur 是第一個做到以完全去中心化的方式來結算預測市場的平台。\n","scalarDenomination":"null","designatedReporter":"0xd2f35fc3ebc5ba2eba8df389790583c64d9e4659","designatedReportStake":"0.511716913293909143","resolutionSource":"https://www.cec.gov.tw/","numTicks":"10000","outcomes":[{"id":0,"volume":"0.155","price":"0.55","description":"柯文哲"},{"id":1,"volume":"0.1236","price":"0.37","description":"姚文智"},{"id":2,"volume":"0.225","price":"0.45","description":"丁守中"},{"id":3,"volume":"0","price":"0.25","description":"其他"}],"tickSize":"0.0001"},{"0":[{"price":"0.25","timestamp":1533594962,"amount":"0.4"},{"price":"0.55","timestamp":1533599425,"amount":"0.1"}],"1":[{"price":"0.5","timestamp":1533595364,"amount":"0.01"},{"price":"0.5","timestamp":1533595437,"amount":"0.01"},{"price":"0.5","timestamp":1533596311,"amount":"0.02"},{"price":"0.37","timestamp":1535332590,"amount":"0.28"}],"2":[{"price":"0.45","timestamp":1533595728,"amount":"0.05"},{"price":"0.45","timestamp":1535239836,"amount":"0.45"}]}],[{"id":"0x3a1e88b12a7511862d2770e158c785ea5b4c3c49","universe":"0xe991247b78f937d7b69cfc00f1a487a293557677","marketType":"scalar","numOutcomes":2,"minPrice":"0.05","maxPrice":"0.15","cumulativeScale":"0.1","author":"0x0ff2af96e2a9fe9b4368a17e5c49ba589233017f","consensus":{"isInvalid":"false","payout":["100000","0"]},"creationTime":1531984740,"creationBlock":5990874,"creationFee":"0.01","settlementFee":"0.0051","reportingFeeRate":"0.0001","marketCreatorFeeRate":"0.005","marketCreatorFeesBalance":"10000000000000000","marketCreatorMailbox":"0x1ccd5a79df25b9424ec5eb20ab98d0ecde8c1b71","marketCreatorMailboxOwner":"0x0ff2af96e2a9fe9b4368a17e5c49ba589233017f","initialReportSize":"349680582682291667","category":"ETHEREUM BITCOIN FUTURE","tags":["CRYPTOCURRENCIES SPREAD","NOVEMBER"],"volume":"0.50104","openInterest":"0.03","outstandingShares":"0.3","feeWindow":"0xebfbd82a0fae468fad25039c76eda131bc93a87e","endTime":1543622340,"finalizationBlockNumber":6899868,"finalizationTime":1545001142,"lastTradeBlockNumber":6668361,"lastTradeTime":1541709881,"reportingState":"FINALIZED","forking":0,"needsMigration":0,"description":"What will ETH/BTC Trade Pair Close Price be @ 11/30/2018 00:00 UTC on Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange?","details":"Reporter: 1) YOU MUST SET YOUR DEVICE’S TIME ZONE TO UTC OR LOSE MONEY! 2) Go to Source URL. 3) Select Original Chart, Set Time to 1D (1 Day). 4) Find Expiration Date on Chart by Hover Cursor over Candlesticks. 5) Get Close Price on Expiration Date as RWO.

the SEC approve the VanEck/CBOE Bitcoin ETF proposal by the end of August 2018?","details":"This market relates only to the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin ETF proposal for an ETF to be listed on CBOE, currently under consideration by the SEC, with a deadline currently scheduled for 16 August 2018. It does NOT relate to any other Bitcoin ETF proposal or approval (including the Direxion and Proshares Bitcoin ETFs that are also under consideration). \n\nThe VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF proposal is believed to be the only one proposing investment in the spot market - ie, purchasing and holding actual Bitcoins, as opposed to investing in cash-settled Bitcoin futures like the other proposals, and accordingly, the proposed VanEck ETF is likely to impact the Bitcoin price much more. \n\nThe Yes condition will be satisfied if the SEC announces approval of the above ETF proposal on its website by the end of 31 August 2018 (Washington DC time). Any other outcome will result in No.","scalarDenomination":"null","designatedReporter":"0x27db2659ec702340244fd21edc02cc876bc7efac","designatedReportStake":"0.349680582682291667","resolutionSource":"https://www.sec.gov/","numTicks":"10000","outcomes":[{"id":0,"volume":"0","price":"0.5","description":"null"},{"id":1,"volume":"0","price":"0.5","description":"null"}],"tickSize":"0.0001"},{}],[{"id":"0x3378fd55a2ecb2ba4b0f805dc8e188387365a690","universe":"0xe991247b78f937d7b69cfc00f1a487a293557677","marketType":"yesNo","numOutcomes":2,"minPrice":"0","maxPrice":"1","cumulativeScale":"1","author":"0xc05067126ca203eb1b90e4a8780b607dd58b23cd","consensus":{"isInvalid":"false","payout":["0","10000"]},"creationTime":1532630953,"creationBlock":6034911,"creationFee":"0.01","settlementFee":"0.0001","reportingFeeRate":"0.0001","marketCreatorFeeRate":"0","marketCreatorFeesBalance":"0","marketCreatorMailbox":"0x96b26f812670b9056f44a7151e43981a0aae222f","marketCreatorMailboxOwner":"0xc05067126ca203eb1b90e4a8780b607dd58b23cd","initialReportSize":"425985741096689448","category":"SPORT","tags":["RUGBY","TOP14"],"volume":"0","openInterest":"0","outstandingShares":"0","feeWindow":"0xd9cd21c7636feeb717164c63c20cd51fd982e8bd","endTime":1536595200,"finalizationBlockNumber":6421633,"finalizationTime":1538229451,"lastTradeBlockNumber":"null","lastTradeTime":"null","reportingState":"FINALIZED","forking":0,"needsMigration":0,"description":" Saturday 8th September 2018 Kick Off 3:45 pm Clermont to beat Paris.
